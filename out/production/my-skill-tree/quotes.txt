437. What I think is amazing is not that 85% of people who get married under the age of 25 get divorced, it’s that 15% of them stay together. How did they manage to pull that off? You almost can’t wait too long. It’s the single simplest measure to predict divorce. – Elizabeth Gilbert

439. I’m glad I was born when I was. My time was the golden age of variety. If I were starting out again now, maybe things would happen for me, but it certainly would not be on a variety show with 28 musicians, 12 dancers, two major guest stars, 50 costumes a week by Bob Mackie.

447. Craziest thing I’ve done for love is getting married. I think it’s crazy. I think it’s crazy, crazy, crazy. I’m never going to say I wouldn’t do it again but I have to make sure it’s love and not settling for the ‘I have to do this by a certain age,’ which is kind of what I did. – Jenny McCarthy

452. Young man, the secret of my success is that an early age I discovered that I was not God. – Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.

459. No, no, I was only funny on stage, really. I, I, think I was funny as a person toward my classmates when I was very young. You know, when I was a child, up to about the age of 12. – Rowan Atkinson

465. But look, I was born in 1956, the peak year for births in US history.

466. I basically get stereotyped a lot in terms of being a girl and writing ‘chick’ music for teenage girls or something.

It’s part of the cultural dynamic, I guess. – Ani DiFranco

467. What is amazing for a woman of my age is that I change as the world is changing-and changing very, very fast. I don’t think my mother had that opportunity to change. – Jeanne Moreau

I think people related to JR back then because we all have someone we know exactly like him. Everyone in the world knows a JR.- Larry Hagman

490. It is my art. I am better at it than I ever was. And I will do it as long as I can. When you reach a certain age you can slough off what is unnecessary and concentrate on what is. And why not? – Arthur Miller

506.

510. We tried not to age, but time had its rage. – Patti Smith

518. With the song ‘This Christmas’ I wanted to do something that was kind of different. I mean, Donny Hathaway is an amazing artist.

539. Just as we reject racism, sexism, ageism, and heterosexism, we reject speciesism.

Francione

546. I could always sing, from a really young age, but my voice was really weird. I used to make my mum turn up the radio every day in our house. She was well into music so I got that from her. – Ellie Goulding

547. I think women get caught up too much in having a plan – ‘I’m going to get married at this age I’m going to have a kid at this age’ – and then they just try to find a guy who will fit into that picture. I don’t want my life to be based on that. – Julia Stiles

562. Work is transformative. It gives you a greater chance of a greater income. You can affect your life while you’re of working age, so you have scope and opportunity. Pensioners do not. – Iain Duncan Smith

563. I think you can’t really escape any kind of spiritual education as a child, whether it’s New Age or Judaism or Buddhism or whatever it is. You can’t escape it, even if you completely disagree with it, you still have it as a foundation that you base things off of. – Jack White

564. At my age the only problem is with remembering names. When I call everyone darling, it has damn all to do with passionately adoring them, but I know I’m safe calling them that. Although, of course, I adore them too. – Richard Attenborough

565. What I really tried to do with Helen was make her show this sad side of her. She was married off at 16, was so young and living in this castle that can’t leave because of how she looks, and married to a man she hates and three times her age. – Diane Kruger

570. I’m 20 years old. I like to party as much as anyone my age. Going clubbing is my way of relaxing or releasing a lot of stress. I don’t feel that I should have to justify that part of my life. I don’t know that I’m necessarily an addict. – Lindsay Lohan

571. I am happy being able to play roles with people my age because once you do something really mature there is no turning back. – Lindsay Lohan

572. Compared to a lot of actresses my age, I’m actually overweight. – Lindsay Lohan

573. This is what I asked for, and in this day and age that’s what actually goes on. But what hurts me the most is that I work just as hard as any other actress around my age, like Scarlett Johansson, but I just don’t get the opportunities that they get because people are so distracted by the mess that I created in my life. – Lindsay Lohan

574. At a young age, I was interested in comic books, which was really how I learnt to read. The name Cage came from a comic book character called Power Man. – Nicolas Cage

576. I can’t wait to be that age and hanging out with a bunch of people hanging out all day playing golf and going to the beach, all my own age. We’d be laughing and having a good time and getting loopy on our prescription drugs. Driving golf carts around. I can’t wait. – Cameron Diaz

577. I would love a family. I’m at the age where the wish for a child gets stronger. But who knows. – Cameron Diaz

578. I love physical kinds of comedy and getting down and dirty and doing stunts. When I was growing up, I was always getting into fights with guys and usually punching out boys my age because I was a lot bigger and tougher. So I’m naturally accustomed to putting myself into the headspace of a girl who can take care of herself. – Cameron Diaz

579. Love, with very young people, is a heartless business. We drink at that age from thirst, or to get drunk it is only later in life that we occupy ourselves with the individuality of our wine. – Isak Dinesen

580. Age for me is just a number. – Haile Gebrselassie

581. You hit a certain age and – especially because of TV – the young cooks coming up say, ‘You’re a sellout, because you’re doing something other than what you should be doing.’ ‘Top Chef’ is a double-edged sword for me: There’s a whole group of people who will not come to the restaurants because they assume I’m not in them anymore, all I do is TV. – Tom Colicchio

582. Some of your teachers are actually closer in age to you than you think. – Maya Lin

587. As a precocious teen I dreamed of being Graham Greene. Well, as it turned out, I never wrote a great novel, sadly, and I never converted to Catholicism, happily, but I did do one thing he did. That is, in middle age I moved to a seaside town and got into a right barney with the local powers-that-be. – Julie Burchill

588. Age should not have its face lifted, but it should rather teach the world to admire wrinkles as the etchings of experience and the firm line of character. – Clarence Day

590. To me, old age is always fifteen years older than I am. – Bernard Baruch

591. I wear clothes that most people in the Midwest would probably deem inappropriate at my age. And I rock a bikini all summer long. I know that it’s not normal, but I just don’t care. I live once. – Liz Phair

592. I’ve lost touch with a lot of that boutique-type music just because of my age, and raising my son and the multiple jobs I have at this point. – Liz Phair

596. When I was younger, my whole sense of self-worth was based on whether or not I was working, which was awful. And I had a baby at 20 years old, so it wasn’t just about me.

597. I grew up on the golden age of children’s TV. – Edward Norton

610. It’s hard for women at my age in Hollywood, but I’m not discouraged. – Jane Fonda

611. We’re still living with the old paradigm of age as an arch. That’s the old metaphor: You’re born, you peak at midlife and decline into decrepitude. – Jane Fonda

613. The reality is sobering: in the United States one in three girls will become pregnant before age 20, totaling more than 750,000 girls per year. – Jane Fonda

617. There are a lot of downsides to being male. We age faster and die younger. But give us this: we’re lifetime baby-making machines. Women’s reproductive abilities start to wane when they’re as young as 35. Men? We’re good to go pretty much till we’re dead. – Jeffrey Kluger

618. Older fatherhood isn’t all bad: testosterone rates drop about 1% per year as men age, making them less reactive and more patient, and a professionally established middle-aged man is likely to have more time and money to devote to his kids than a twenty-something who’s just getting started. – Jeffrey Kluger

619. Credit or debit cards, for starters, are nothing short of shoppers’ Novocain. Even in the age of digital purchases and virtual money, we still attach a special value to dirty paper with pictures of presidents on it.

620. When it comes to raising civilized kids there are no hard rules, but there are two things on which most parents agree: Boys are generally wilder than girls, and adolescents are wilder than kids of any other age. If you’ve got an adolescent boy, you’re in the sweet spot for trouble. – Jeffrey Kluger

628. It begins and ends with money. It’s absurd in this day and age when we need so much money for education, health, for people, that a $100 million dollars can be spent on a film. It’s obscene. – Kathleen Turner

629. I am at that age when you panic at the slightest thing. – Rupert Everett

630. Being gay and being a woman has one big thing in common, which is that we both become invisible after the age of 42. Who wants a gay 50-year-old? No one, let me tell you. – Rupert Everett

631. I began to speak well at a very advanced age – 15, 16, 17 years old. It was psychological: the trauma of war, my family and growing up on my own. I was more or less a street kid. – Roberto Cavalli

632. We Jews have a special attachment to the Book. The study of page after page in tomes yellowing with age was obligatory. – Theodore Bikel

637. Middle age: when you begin to exchange your emotions for symptoms. – Irvin S. Cobb

638. Brain power improves by brain use, just as our bodily strength grows with exercise. And there is no doubt that a large proportion of the female population, from school days to late middle age, now have very complicated lives indeed. – A. N. Wilson

639. I began to understand my sensations, to know what I wanted, at around the age of forty – but only vaguely. – Camille Pissarro

640. I grew up on a farm in a small town where you do or say one thing and everybody knows about it.

641. If you love somebody, you love them. My parents had a 25-year age gap between them and my mum was the breadwinner, my dad the house husband. I’m a strong believer that a good relationship can work, whatever the situation. – Katherine Jenkins

647. Losing both parents at a young age gave me a sense that you can’t really control life – so you’d better live it while it’s here. I stopped believing in a storybook existence a long time ago. All you can do is push in a direction and see what comes of it. – Jon Hamm

648. Old age is not a disease – it is strength and survivorship, triumph over all kinds of vicissitudes and disappointments, trials and illnesses. – Maggie Kuhn

658. I don’t look my age, I don’t feel my age and I don’t act my age. To me age is just a number. – Joan Collins

661. We incorporated new tastes and flavors into our kids’ diets from a very early age, which helped to develop their palates and prevented them from becoming picky eaters.

681. I came back to work when my children were two months old. At that early age, they seem to have little awareness of anybody but their Raggedy Ann dolls, so it wasn’t a matter of them missing me. I was missing them. – Jane Pauley

682. Being successful at a very young age gave me the confidence and the capability to try out other things. – Joshua Lederberg

696. From age 16, I lived and breathed wine. I read every magazine and book about wine. – Gary Vaynerchuk

697. IQ is a commodity, data is a commodity. I’m far more interested in watching people interact at a restaurant with their smartphone.

702. I think all writers of my age who are brought up on films probably by the age of 16 have seen many more films than they have read classics of literature. We can’t help but be influenced by film. Film has got some great tricks that it’s taught writers. – David Mitchell

703. Some broad themes brought me where I am today. At a very young age, my hobby became thinking and finding connections. – Dean Kamen

704. I think you have to be a little bit strict. You can’t be friend and their parent in a lot of situations, especially in this day and age where it’s so dangerous for kids. So there’s a bit of sternness, I guess, in the way I raise my kids. – Tim McGraw

705. In the 1970s and 1980s there was so little decent fiction for young people, but we’re now in a golden age that shows no sign of fading. Philip Pullman, J. K. Rowling, Lemony Snicket are only three of the best known among a good number of equals. – David Mitchell

711. I hope to have one more boxing match at the age of 55. Given that demographic at the age of 55 to 65, you’ve got to make a statement with your life. Otherwise, you are just existing. – George Foreman

720. I was well motivated. What I wanted to do was work for myself. I had twenty two jobs before I started my business at the age of twenty three and I didn’t want one more boss telling me what to do. So I was motivated simply because I didn’t want a boss. – Barbara Corcoran

721. Regardless of age, regardless of position, regardless of the business we happen to be in, all of us need to understand the importance of branding. We are CEOs of our own companies: Me, Inc.

722. An age which is incapable of poetry is incapable of any kind of literature except the cleverness of a decadence. – Raymond Chandler

740. Despite what anti-aging ads say, growing older can be better. I feel better in my skin, 100 percent. You have greater effects of gravity, but the better sense of yourself you have is something I wouldn’t trade. Women who lie about their age – ‘why?’ – Demi Moore

754. I’m never overawed by a situation and I think that’s because I’ve always looked several years older than I am. So because people were treating me like I was 40 when I was 29, I’ve always felt in control of a situation. People used to say, when you’re 32, you’ll look 32.

755. I am 54 and age is slowly writing itself on my face. – Arthur Smith
